## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
set.seed(1) ##for reproducibility to get the same split
sample<-sample.int(nrow(white), floor(.80*nrow(white)), replace = F)
trainwhite<-white[sample, ] ##training data frame
testwhite<-white[-sample, ] ##test data frame

set.seed(1) ##for reproducibility to get the same split
sample2<-sample.int(nrow(red), floor(.80*nrow(red)), replace = F)
trainred<-red[sample, ] ##training data frame
testred<-red[-sample, ] ##test data frame

trainwhite <- trainwhite%>%
  mutate("Kind" = "white")
trainred <- trainred%>%
  mutate("Kind" = "red")
train_together <- rbind(trainwhite, trainred)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
regnull <- lm(~1, data=train_together) ##model with all predictors 
regfull <- lm(mpg~., data=train_together)
step(regnull, scope=list(lower=regnull, upper=regfull), direction="forward")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
result <- lm(quality~., data=train_together)
summary(result)
```

```{r}
train_together$quality<-factor(train_together$quality) 


ggplot(train_together,aes(x=fixed.acidity, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of fixed.acidity by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=volatile.acidity, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of volatile.acidity by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=citric.acid, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of citric.acid by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=residual.sugar, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of residual.sugar by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=chlorides, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of chlorides by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=free.sulfur.dioxide, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of free.sulfur.dioxide by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=total.sulfur.dioxide, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of total.sulfur.dioxide by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=density, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of desnity by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=pH, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of pH by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=sulphates, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of sulfates by quality")

ggplot(train_together,aes(x=alcohol, color=quality))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Density Plot of alcohol by quality")

##produce the 4 density plots in a 2 by 2 matrix
#grid.arrange(dp1, dp2, dp3, dp4, dp5, dp6, ncol = 2, nrow = 3)


```
```{r}
ggplot(train_together, aes(x=quality, fill=Kind))+
  geom_bar(position = "fill")+
  labs(x="quality", y="Proportion",
       title="Proportion of Kind by quality")
```
